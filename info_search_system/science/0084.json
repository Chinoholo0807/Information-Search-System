The document outlines policy measures to strengthen support and guidance on the production, distribution, special effects and talent training of sci-fi movies.\nThe implementation of these measures will be a major topic of the two-day conference. According to CAST, the event will also see the launch of a national sci-fi film screening alliance.\nJointly organized by CAST and the Beijing municipal government, this year's conference will feature both online and offline events, including an opening ceremony, forums and exhibitions.
