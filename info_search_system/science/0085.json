China shared its COVID-19 prevention and control experience with the international society by building an open scientific service platform, which served 175 countries and regions, and was downloaded more than 160 million times.\nTo cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been pushing forward international cooperation in the research and development of detection kits, drugs and treatment methods as well as vaccines.\nThe country has also joined COVAX, an international initiative aimed at ensuring equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines, becoming the largest economy so far to support the initiative.
