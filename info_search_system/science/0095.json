As a leading sci-tech park and innovation hub in China, it has established itself as an international platform for scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation. The ZGC Forum has been held 11 times since its inception in 2007.\nZhongguancun takes advantage of the scientific and educational resources in the Chinese capital, which boasts nearly 100 universities and more than 1,000 scientific research institutes, fully displaying the implementation of China's innovation-driven development strategy.\n\"The theme for this meeting perfectly captures today's key priority.

That is the reason why we are glad to count it as a trustworthy partner for a long time,\" said Lionel Grotto, CEO of the Paris Region Investment Promotion Bureau, in his video message to the forum.\nPeople take part in the opening of the 2020 Zhongguancun Forum (ZGC Forum) in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 17, 2020. (Xinhua/Ren Chao)\nChinese and foreign IT, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies and institutes are expected to bring to the forum 16 new products with the latest technologies for their world debut.\nDai Qionghai, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a professor with the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, said he would highlight the importance of information technology in boosting the health industry.\nDai noted that traditional analysis methods are limited by insufficient human resources, low efficiency and other factors. They need the help of cloud computing, 5G technology, Internet of Things, blockchain, AI and big data, among other technologies.\nDuring the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, companies at Zhongguancun rolled out a host of new technologies and products for epidemic control and prevention.\nIn a factory of Leyard Group, a Zhongguancun-based visualization solution provider, production lines are running at full capacity.
