    "content": "BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- China has made achievements in the agricultural-product processing industry through innovations in science and technology during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) period, said the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).\nIn 2020, the operating income of China's agricultural processing industry exceeded 23.2 trillion yuan (about 3.6 trillion U.S. dollars), an increase of 1.2 trillion yuan year on year. The conversion rate of agricultural processing has reached 67.5 percent.\nThe contribution of science and technology to the development of the agricultural processing industry has reached 63 percent, providing strong support for its long-term and stable growth.\nChinese scientists have made breakthroughs in key technologies such as deep processing of agricultural products and post-harvest loss reduction during the period, said the CAAS.\nThe quality and safety of China's agricultural products have constantly improved since the country established advanced monitoring systems and standardized regulations in the field.\nDuring the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), China will step up its efforts in research innovation of agricultural-product processing technology and build a basic theoretical system to promote the industry's quality and safety, said the CAAS.\nThe CAAS said it would strive for more breakthroughs in key technologies and automatic control of the whole industrial chain.\nIt also vowed to promote the construction of state laboratories.
