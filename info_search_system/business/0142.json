    "content": "SEOUL, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- Sentiment among South Korean businesses over economic situations slightly worsened this month on the back of the continued COVID-19 pandemic, central bank data showed Wednesday.\nThe business sentiment index (BSI) came in at 76 in February, down 1 point from the previous month, according to the Bank of Korea (BOK).\nIt came as the daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases remained in triple digits in the past months. In the latest tally, the country reported 440 more cases for the past 24 hours, raising the total number of infections to 88,120.\nThe results were based on a survey of 1,649 manufacturers and 1,175 non-manufacturers conducted from Feb. 8 to Feb. 17. The index below 100 indicates pessimists outnumbering optimists.\nThe BSI among manufacturers shrank 3 points in February from a month earlier, but the index for non-manufacturers kept rising for two straight months.\nThe prospective BSI for March advanced 3 points to 78 on a monthly basis ahead of the COVID-19 vaccinations set to begin later this week.
