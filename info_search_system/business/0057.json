The digital revolution is placing greater emphasis on provision of strong, technical support through call centers. Firms in the sector want to be located close to a source of skilled workers.\"\nThe country has seen growth in call centers, technical support and back and front office services for major multinational and South African firms, said Patel, predicting that South Africa will experience higher growth rates in the next few years.
