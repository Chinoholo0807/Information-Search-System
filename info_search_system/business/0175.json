    "content": "Xi processes a design plan at a cafe in Qingyang District, Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan Province, Jan. 27, 2021. Zeng Xi, a graduate of mathematics from an university in Toronto of Canada, chose to go against her parents' wish by making her life with artistic creations in flower arrangement. While still learning abroad, Zeng saw the tremendous market potential for flower arrangement in China when she accidentally visited her home. Having tried out with a studio of flower arrangement in Hong Kong in south China in 2018, Zeng brought her rich experience back to her hometown in Chengdu, and started to initiate a nationwide business network in 2019. Zeng wishes to make her fair share of contribution to the development of the art and creation sector in her homeland. (Xinhua/Liu Mengqi) \n"
