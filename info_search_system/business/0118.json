    "content": " Yan Jiaxin (2nd L) handles invoices with a material delivery worker in Qiaotuo Village of Tai'an County, Anshan, northeast China's Liaoning Province, March 4, 2021. Yan Jiaxin is a household name in her hometown Qiaotuo Village, because the 21-year-old entrepreneur has been running a handicraft factory which employs local women and sells products to European markets. When she graduated from a vocational school in 2017, Yan decided to go home instead of taking job opportunities in Dalian, a nearby big city. She was determined to help her fellow villagers get rid of poverty by starting a handicraft business. With careful preparatory work and support from village officials, Yan's business fledged with the participation of many local women, who now make handicraft goods to fulfill orders from Europe by the hundreds of thousands.
