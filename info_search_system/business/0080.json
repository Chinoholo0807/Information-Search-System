    "content": "WELLINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The latest Wellington and New Zealand's central region business confidence survey showed growth and an improvement in business confidence, said the Wellington Chamber of Commerce and Business Central on Monday.\n\"It's good to see business confidence has improved significantly quarter-on-quarter and that businesses are the most optimistic they have been in some time,\" said Simon Arcus, chief executive of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce and Business Central.\n\"But while sentiment is improving it remains fragile, perhaps best characterized as the first 'green shoots.' Any negative changes in the COVID environment or a stumble in the vaccine rollout could derail confidence,\" said Arcus.\nBusinesses' confidence in the New Zealand economy is at net positive 14 percent, up from net negative 8 percent. Confidence in the regional economy is at net positive 13 percent, up from net positive 8 percent, and businesses' confidence in their own business is at net positive 41 percent, up from net positive 22 percent.\n\"It is also a reflection that the Wellington and wider Central New Zealand region have not been as heavily impacted by the two recent lockdowns,\" said Arcus.\nThe latest business confidence survey was conducted during a 15-day period between the March 5-19. There was a total of 250 responses. Enditem\n"
