    "content": "BERLIN, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Business sentiment in Germany deteriorated in January and the corresponding business climate index declined from 92.2 points in December 2020, to 90.1 points in January, the ifo Institute said on Monday.\nThe assessment of the current situation and the expectations of companies were both more pessimistic in January after a brief recovery of the index in December last year, according to the monthly survey of 9,000 German companies conducted by the ifo Institute.\n\"The second wave of coronavirus has brought the recovery of the German economy to a halt for now,\" said Clemens Fuest, president of the institute.\nIn the German manufacturing sector, the index fell again after eight consecutive increases. Expectations were \"notably less optimistic\" among manufacturing companies. In contrast, assessments of the current situation were \"considerably better,\" the ifo report said.\nIn Germany's service sector, the business climate index was \"significantly lower,\" and companies were \"much more pessimistic about the coming months.\"\n\"In trade, the business climate index nosedived.\" In its sharpest decline since April 2020, the indicator for the current situation in Germany's trade sector \"plummeted into negative territory.... Sentiment worsened across almost all retail segments, in some cases drastically.\" Enditem\n"
