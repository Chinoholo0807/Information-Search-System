    "content": "BELGRADE, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- For a long time in Montenegro, foreign direct investment accounted for 18 or 19 percent of its GDP, which showed that Montenegro has created, and will continue creating, a good business environment for investors, President Milo Djukanovic said on Friday.\nDjukanovic made the remarks at an online video conference \"Economic and investment challenges after COVID\", which was held in Beijing and was attended by representatives from more than 50 Chinese companies that have already operated in Montenegro or are interested in Montenegro, the president's office said in a press release.\n\"Foreign investments have given an important impetus to the successes we have achieved in the past 14 and a half years,\" Djukanovic said. The Balkan country declared independence in mid-2006.\nDuring the speech, he praised Montenegro's cooperation with the China Road and Bridge Construction Company (CRBC), which is building a 41-km long section of highway, the first phase of the planned 180-km Bar-Boljare highway, connecting the north and south of this mountainous Adriatic country.\nThe historic role of CRBC in Phase 1 of the construction of Montenegro's first highway Bar-Boljare recommends it as a partner in the further development of the country's transport infrastructure, he said.\n\"I believe that this year we will realize the first phase of the highway project. I have to remind you that this is the most expensive and technologically most challenging project that Montenegro ever realizes in its history,\" the president added. Enditem\n"
