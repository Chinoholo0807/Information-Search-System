    "content": "BERLIN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of business insolvencies in Germany in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 1999, the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) said on Wednesday, partially thanks to the government's temporary suspension of obligation to file for insolvency amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nWith only 15,841 companies officially registering for insolvency in 2020, insolvencies declined by 15.5 percent year-on-year, according to Destatis.\nHowever, the annual result for 2020 was \"considerably affected by the suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency during the coronavirus crisis,\" Destatis noted. The suspension until the end of 2020 was introduced by the German government to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.\nFor companies that were still awaiting November payments from COVID-19 state aid, the suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency was extended until April 30, according to the government.\nThe expected claims of creditors from business insolvencies filed in Germany almost doubled from 26.8 billion euros (31.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2019 to about 44.1 billion euros in 2020, according to Destatis.\nAlthough the number of business insolvencies in Germany declined, resulting financial claims rose due to \"more economically significant companies\" filing for insolvency, Destatis noted.
