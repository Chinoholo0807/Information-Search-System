    "content": "SEOUL, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sentiment among South Korean businesses over economic situation improved for two months amid a continued export recovery, central bank data showed Thursday.\nThe business sentiment index (BSI) came to 88 in April, up 5 points from the previous month, according to the Bank of Korea (BOK).\nIt continued to rise for the second consecutive month, hitting the highest in about 10 years since June 2011.\nThe results are based on a survey of 1,662 manufacturers and 1,154 non-manufacturers conducted from April 14-21. The reading below 100 indicates pessimists outnumbering optimists.\nThe enhanced business sentiment was attributed to the continued export recovery. The country's export kept rising for five straight months through March.\nThe BSI for manufacturers advanced 7 points over the month to 96 in April, while the reading for non-manufacturers gained 5 points to 82 this month.
