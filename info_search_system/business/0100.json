The plan stressed the HKSAR's important roles in sectors including finance, innovative technology, shipping, trade, professional services, intellectual property rights and cultural exchanges, and specifically highlighted its role in connecting domestic and international markets.\nCoordinated development with the Chinese mainland will foster new growth drivers for Hong Kong. According to the plan, China will support Hong Kong in better integrating its own development into the overall national development on a larger platform, such as the joint building of the Belt and Road and the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, to name a few.\nProduced by Xinhua Global Service\n"
