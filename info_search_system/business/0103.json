    "content": "JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) on Wednesday said South Africa's Business Confidence Index (BCI) declined from 40 to 35 in the first quarter of 2021, showing the fragility of the economic recovery.\nThe RMB interviewed 1,300 business people during the second half of February and found that about seven out of ten senior executives expressed their dissatisfaction with prevailing business conditions, up from six previously.\n\"Such underlying dynamics are not reflective of a robust economic upswing. On the contrary, it talks to one that is rooted in a fragile foundation,\" said RMB chief economist Ettienne Le Roux.\nHe expressed fear that the third wave of COVID-19 might hit the country, resulting in some lockdown restrictions being reinstated and load shedding.\nThe BCI indicates the percentage of business people that are satisfied with prevailing conditions. It can vary between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates an extreme lack of confidence, 50 neutrality and 100 extreme confidence. Enditem\n"
