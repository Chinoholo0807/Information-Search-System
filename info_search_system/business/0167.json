    "content": "TASHKENT, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Uzbek government plans to allow businesses to install cameras on the roads and earn cash on reporting traffic violations in a move to reduce road accidents, according to a draft government resolution Monday.\nThe proposed resolution to involve the private sector in ensuring road safety offers businesses 25 percent of the fine for each reported offence registered by their automated photo and video equipment.\nThe locations for installing photo-video cameras would be auctioned online, the document said.\nIn 2019, Uzbek authorities allowed citizens to send dashboard camera footage of traffic violations to a government website for a financial reward, and recently they were allowed to report traffic offences using cellphones.\nFines for violating road traffic rules range from 12 U.S. dollars up to 700 dollars. More than 1,900 people were killed and 6,700 others were injured in almost 8,600 motor accidents in the Central Asian nation in 2019, according to official data. Enditem\n"
