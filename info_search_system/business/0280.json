    "content": "\n\nListed as a \"village of beauty and leisure\" by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in 2020, Jijiadun in east China's Jiangsu Province has been given a new lease of life thanks to its ambitious young residents.\nIn the past, young people would usually leave to earn a living because of the village's poor economy.\nBut since 2015, the local government has encouraged young people to start their own businesses, such as guesthouses, restaurants, and art centers, to develop rural tourism in the area.\n\n"
