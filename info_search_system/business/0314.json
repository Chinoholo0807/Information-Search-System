(Xinhua Photo)\nDUBAI, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has allowed expatriate investors to have 100 percent ownership of their own companies without the need for an Emirati sponsor, the official WAM news agency reported on Monday.\nAccording to a decree by President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, companies that want to open branches in the UAE can also do so without a local sponsor, to improve UAE's position regionally and globally as an attractive destination for investments and projects.\nSuch measures will reduce costs and improve the ease of doing business in the country. With these changes, it is not mandatory to have an Emirati sponsor to be the chairperson of a company. The board of directors also do not need to have an Emirati majority.\nHowever, companies in sectors, such as oil and gas, utility and transport, as well as strategic sectors, are exempt from these changes.  \n"
