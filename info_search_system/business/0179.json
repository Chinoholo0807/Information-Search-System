    "content": "COPENHAGEN, Feb. 1 (Xinhua) -- The use of Danish issued payment cards experienced a year-on-year decline for the first time since their introduction in 1983, according to the payments statement of 2020 issued by Denmark's National Bank on Monday.\nAccording to the statement, the total turnover of payments on Danish issued payment cards fell by 0.9 percent in comparison to 2019.\nThe statement went on to elaborate that the decline represented an aberration from historical norms since payment cards have normally experienced an increase of about 5 percent annually \"due to general economic growth and card payments displacing cash payment.\"\nIn addition, card sales in e-commerce have increased by 7.5 percent, while in the physical stores there has been a decrease of 3.1 percent.\nThe statement attributed the restrictions against COVID-19 as the factor behind the atypical decline and identified the hardest hit as the experience industry, such as airlines travel agents, entertainment, hotels and restaurants, which over the year experienced a 36.1 percent decline in card revenue.\nAlternatively, supermarkets and housing-related goods and services saw an upsurge in the use of card sales with an increase of 10.5 and 19.1 percent, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\"The increased revenue within these two industries can be attributed to the fact that they are to a less degree affected by restrictions; that they have converted part of their sales to e-commerce; and that the Danes have changed their consumption patterns,\" said the statement.
