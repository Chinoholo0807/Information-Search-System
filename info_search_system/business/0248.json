Things are getting better but they are getting better with still a dose of uncertainty,\" said Antonio Fatas, Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.\nA quarter of the companies in the survey were most concerned about businesses shedding jobs, which would bite into consumption, it said.\nStill, half of the respondents underscored the possible scarcity of vaccines in parts of the world at least in the initial stage as their biggest risk.
