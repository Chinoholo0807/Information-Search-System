Registration departments shall enhance compliance oversight, and refuse to register or correct the corporate names inconsistent with the requirements. Disputes over corporate names may be settled through lawsuits or mediated or decided by registration departments, according to the meeting.\n\"Corporate name registration shall facilitate fair competition and independent business operations within the confines of the law,\" Li said at the meeting.
