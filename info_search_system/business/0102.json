On the contrary, it talks to one that is rooted in a fragile foundation,\" said RMB chief economist Ettienne Le Roux.\nHe expressed fear that the third wave of COVID-19 might hit the country, resulting in some lockdown restrictions being reinstated and load shedding.\nThe BCI indicates the percentage of business people that are satisfied with prevailing conditions. It can vary between 0 and 100, where 0 indicates an extreme lack of confidence, 50 neutrality and 100 extreme confidence.  \n"
