    "content": "BERLIN, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- One year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the business situation and expectations of German companies were \"still far from pre-crisis levels,\" the Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said on Thursday.\nSo far, the COVID-19 crisis has reduced Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) by around 190 billion euros (230.5 billion U.S. dollars), according to DIHK.\nGerman companies across all sectors assessed their current business situation more negatively than in fall 2020, with 32 percent describing the current situation as poor and only 29 percent as good, according to a survey among more than 30,000 German companies.\nMany companies did not look positively into the future as 31 percent expected business to get worse, while only 22 percent of companies expected things to improve, according to the survey.\nThe service sector was particularly affected by the ongoing lockdown, with seven percent even facing bankruptcy. And 94 percent of travel agents, 87 percent of restaurateurs and 64 percent of personal service providers such as hairdressers or gyms reported poor business.\nUnlike the overall economy, Germany's industry was proving to be \"comparatively robust,\" DIHK noted. According to the survey, 31 percent of industrial companies already reported a good business situation while only 25 percent described business as poor.\nDIHK is expecting economic growth of 2.8 percent for 2021, slightly below the latest government forecast at 3.0 percent.
