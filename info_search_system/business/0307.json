The figure below 100 indicates pessimists outnumbering optimists.\nIn the latest tally, South Korea reported 382 more cases of COVID-19 for the past 24 hours, raising the total number of infections to 31,735.\nThe daily caseload hovered above 300 for two straight days, growing in triple digits for 18 days running.\nThe BSI among manufacturers stood at 85 in November, up 6 points from the previous month.
