    "content": "PARIS, Feb. 24 (Xinhua) -- French business managers' confidence was slightly down in February from a month earlier as a sluggish performance of service and retail trade, the worst hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, has offset an improvement in manufacturing activity, the national statistics bureau INSEE said on Wednesday.\nThe business climate composite indicator, compiled from a survey on business managers in the main market sectors -- manufacturing, services, construction, wholesale and retail -- stood at 90 this month, lower than 91 recorded in January, and remained significantly below its long-term average of 100.\n\"This slight decrease reflects different moves depending on the business sector, in a context of a continuing health crisis,\" INSEE said.\nCompared to last month's figures, the business climate in retail trade lost 4 points to 89, while that of services dropped to 88 from 92 reported in January. Manufacturing gained one point to 97.\nAfter two months of slight improvement, the employment climate fell by three points to 85 \"mainly due to the fall in the balances of opinion on the change in the workforce size in retail trade,\" according to the statistics institute.
