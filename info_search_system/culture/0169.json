The name of China's first-known archaeological culture, the Yangshao Culture, was also derived from the site.\nIn 1951 and 1980, China launched its second and third excavation on the ruins.\nOriginating on the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the Yangshao Culture is considered an important stream of Chinese civilization, and widely known for its advanced pottery-making technology.
