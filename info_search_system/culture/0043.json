    "content": "BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand may celebrate its traditional new year Songkran as usual around mid-April, Culture Minister Itthiphol Khunpluem said Wednesday.\nThe water-splashing festival was canceled last year due to COVID-19 concerns. This year, it might be allowed to organize nationwide from April 13 to 15, given the improvement in the local pandemic situation, according to the culture minister.\nNevertheless, the authorities are yet to apply social distancing measures against a possible spread among Songkran revelers at any crowded venues, Itthiphol said.\nThe annual festival is believed to help stimulate the tourist industry throughout the country, he said.\nThailand reported 35 new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday, which marks the 12th day of double-digit daily new cases.
