While most of the performers are overseas Chinese, there were also local fellows joining the concert to show their talent in Chinese songs.\nThe two-hour New Year concert featured some famous and classic Chinese songs and performances such as the Wushu performance, Colourful Clouds Chasing the Moon, and Me and My Motherland.\nThe first concert session of the online charity concert series organised by the Culture Bridge debuted in early 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown when a group of overseas Chinese students joined a global rally to sing for COVID-19 frontline health workers. The online concerts have since been joined by over 2,000 young performers globally, according to its organizer. The New Year concert was the ninth session of the online charity concert series.
