    "content": "KATHMANDU, Oct. 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Yogesh Bhattarai on Saturday confirmed that he tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the first cabinet minister hit by the virus.\nIn a social media post, the minister said his swab was tested on Saturday morning. After testing negative for COVID-19 on Oct. 5, he participated in some events outside the capital Kathmandu. After developing a fever on Friday evening, he got himself tested again on Saturday morning and found to be infected.\n\"Till now, no other health complication has appeared except marginal fever,\" he wrote.\nBhattarai later confirmed to Xinhua on his infection in a telephone conversation. \"I have been staying in home isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus,\" Bhattarai said.\nThe minister fell victim to the virus after the infection of at least five of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's aides.\nSome of the aides have reported negative results of new tests after days of home isolation. Press advisor Surya Thapa told Xinhua on Saturday that he was given all-clear by the latest test.\nThe aides' infections have raised concern about the potential risks for the prime minister. Bhattarai said they have maintained adequate social distance with the prime minister and followed other health protocols during the cabinet meetings.\nAs of Saturday, Nepal has recorded a total of 105,684 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the health ministry.
