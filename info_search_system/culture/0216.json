    "content": "JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The China Cultural Center in Tel Aviv has launched an online photo exhibition displaying the rich cultural and tourism resources in central China's Hubei Province.\nWith a total of 45 photos, the exhibition has three categories -- \"natural ecology,\" \"history and culture\" and \"happy life\" of Hubei, providing a window to discover the province with a long history and rich cultural resources, Tao Chen, director of the China Cultural Center, said on Wednesday.\nTao told Xinhua in an interview that the photo exhibition comprehensively showcased the natural landscapes, historical sites and rapid social and economic development of Hubei.\nIsraeli audience are expected to have a better understanding of Hubei through viewing the exhibition with photos of places such as Huanhelou (Yellow Crane Tower) which was rebuilt many times over the past 1,700 years, and Shennongjia, a large primitive forest and national park.\nThe China Cultural Center earnestly translated captions of each photo into Hebrew language for Israeli audience, so that they could read the detailed introduction of each photo in Hebrew when they just click on the screen of computers or smart cellphones.\nAs planned, the China Cultural Center will cooperate with Hubei Province this year to bring a lot of events for the Israeli people, said Tao, adding that some events could not be held on schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThus, the two sides turned to the online platform to present the beauty of Hubei to the Israeli people, Tao added.\nThe exhibition, started on May 5, will last for a month.
