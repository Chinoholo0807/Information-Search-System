    "content": "LHASA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region has utilized around 119 million yuan (about 16.82 million U.S. dollars) of central government subsidies on public culture development in 2019, especially in primary-level areas, local authorities said.\nThe funds were spent in sectors including subsidizing free admission to public culture facilities, developing public digital cultural products and promoting traditional Tibetan opera in rural areas, according to the regional culture department.\nThanks to the subsidies, public culture venues in Tibet are now freely available to the public for 40 hours per week. More than 20,000 cultural activities have been held and around 2 million people have benefited, according to Migmar, an official with the department.\nCurrently, all prefectures and cities in Tibet have public libraries and museums, and all counties and townships have cultural centers.\nTibet has also funded and established 76 county-level art troupes and over 2,400 amateur art performance teams, which can provide more entertainment choices for residents in remote rural areas.
